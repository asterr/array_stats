* Docs[https://github.com/asterr/array_stats]
* Source[https://github.com/asterr/array_stats]

== DESCRIPTION:

Simple statistics for ruby arrays -- mean, median, sum, and percentile.  For more complex
applications, you should consider NArray[http://narray.rubyforge.org/].

== SYNOPSIS:

Adds convenient methods to grab stats from a Ruby array, including:
* mean
* median
* sum (named total_sum to avoid ActiveRecord conflicts)
* percentile

Percentile calculations are based on the NIST formula[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc252.htm] for percentiles.

== EXAMPLE:

  require 'array_stats'
  
  puts [1,3,5,7].mean
  > 4
  
  puts [1,2,3,4].total_sum
  > 10
  
  puts [1,2,3,4,5].median
  > 3
  
  puts [1,2,3,4,5].percentile(50)
  > 3
   
== INSTALL:

* <tt>git clone https://github.com/asterr/array_stats.git
      cd array_stats<
      gem build array_stats.gemspec
      sudo gem install ./array_stats-0.6.1.gem</tt>
